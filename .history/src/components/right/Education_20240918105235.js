          You can keep this relatively short. Talk a bit about your major, when
          you graduated (or when you WILL graduate), and any accomplishments you
          made while you were there. Deans list, sports teams, clubs, whatever
          shows you&apos;ve put in some effort!

          If you&apos;ve got more than one education to list, dope! Add it.
          Don&apos;t feel like you have to add your high school if you
          don&apos;t feel it&apos;s relevant, but it doesn&apos;t hurt if
          you&apos;ve got some other cool stuff (captain of a team etc) to show
          off.
